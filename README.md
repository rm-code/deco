# Deco

Deco is a user interface library for the [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org/) framework written in Lua and __currently in development__.

Deco provides a set of small building blocks, which can be used to put together more complicated UI elements. By keeping coupling between different elements to a minimum, the different elements can be combined freely and therefore make it easy to extend the UI with new features or adjust existing ones.

It was written as a replacement for the old UI code in the git visualisation software [LoGiVi](https://github.com/rm-code/logivi).

## Example

For example this code creates an image panel, which can be dragged around freely and highlights its contents when the mouse is hovering over it:

```lua
local SimplePanel = {};

function SimplePanel.new(x, y, w, h)
    local bodyBaseCol = { 80, 80, 80, 255 };
    local shadowCol = { 20, 20, 20, 100 };
    local hlCol = { 255, 255, 255, 80 };

    local img = love.graphics.newImage('example.jpg');

    local self = BaseDecorator.new();
    self:attach(DraggableDecorator  .new(0, 0, 0, 0));
    self:attach(MouseOverDecorator  .new(hlCol, 0, 0, 0, 0));
    self:attach(ImageDecorator      .new(img, 1, 1, -2, -2));
    self:attach(BoxDecorator        .new('fill', bodyBaseCol, 0, 0, 0, 0));
    self:attach(BoxDecorator        .new('fill', shadowCol, 8, 8, 0, 0));
    self:attach(BaseComponent       .new(x, y, w, h));
    return self;
end

return SimplePanel;
```

Want to add a header? Simply add more decorators. Want to make it static? Remove the _draggable_ decorator.

## Contributing

This library is in early stages of development and is in dire need of some "_real-world_" testing.
